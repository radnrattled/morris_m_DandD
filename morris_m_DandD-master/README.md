## Megan's Puzzle bugs

#Fixing the bugs in the puzzle app. 

##The Plan

#Reseting the puzzle pieces

# I know that I need to use the removeChild fuction to remove the children of the puzzleBoard. I would assume that I'm going to want to do this within my changeImgSet function because I want this even to happen when the images are changed. I assumed the "dropZones" would be the parent and the puzzlePieces the child but that didn't work so I tried a bunch of different variations calling on pieces and puzzleBoard but nothing worked. 

#Allowing only one piece in the drop zone

#I was thinking that if "removeChild" was a thing then maybe "onlyChild" would work for allowing only one child in the parent DropZones.  I was wrong.

#Conclusion I've been at this for hours now and I can't make anything work. Any research I do pulls up lines and lines of code and no simple one line solutions. I'm lost and I give up. I think I understand the general idea of what I need to do, but how to actually accomplish it is beyond me.
